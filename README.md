# Parallel Programming Tutorials – README

Welcome to this tutorial series on **parallel programming and multiprocessing in Python**.

Please **explore the tutorial scripts first** and then complete the exercises accordingly.

---

## How to use this repository

1. Go through each tutorial file in order:
   - `tutorial1.py`
   - `tutorial2.py`
   - `tutorial3.py`
   - `tutorial4.py`
   - `tutorial5.py`

2. Run each script and observe:
   - The difference between **serial execution**
   - The difference between **parallel execution**
   - Execution time comparisons
   - How multiprocessing and process pools work

These tutorials demonstrate how Python can run tasks:
- sequentially (one after another)
- in parallel (multiple processes at the same time)

Understanding these examples will help you complete the exercises.

## Exercises

After reviewing the tutorials, complete the following exercises:

- `exercise1-2.md`
- `exercise2.md`
- `exercise3.md`

You should:
- Study the tutorial code carefully  
- Reuse ideas and patterns from the tutorials  
- Implement the required functions in the exercises  
- Test both serial and parallel versions  
- Measure execution time where required  

The exercises are designed to help you apply the concepts from the tutorials, including multiprocessing, process pools, and performance comparison.

---

## Expected workflow

1. Read the tutorial  
2. Run the code  
3. Understand what it does  
4. Modify the code if needed  
5. Work on the exercises  
6. Test your solutions  

Do **not** jump directly to the exercises without exploring the tutorials first.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Standard libraries:
  - `time`
  - `multiprocessing`
  - `concurrent.futures`
  - `requests` (for Exercise 2)

---

## Goal

By completing these tutorials and exercises, you should be able to:

- Understand serial vs parallel execution  
- Use multiprocessing in Python  
- Use ProcessPoolExecutor  
- Measure performance  
- Apply parallel programming to real tasks
