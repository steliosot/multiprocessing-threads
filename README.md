# Parallel Programming Tutorials – README

Welcome to this tutorial series on **parallel programming and multiprocessing in Python**.

Please **start with `tutorial.md`**, explore it carefully, and then move to the tutorial scripts and exercises.

---

## How to use this repository

### 1️⃣ Start here
Begin with:

- `tutorial.md`

This file provides:
- Step-by-step guidance  
- Explanations of key concepts  
- Sample code with comments  
- Instructions on how to approach the exercises  

Read it fully before running any code.

---

### 2️⃣ Then explore the tutorial scripts

After reading `tutorial.md`, go through each tutorial file in order:

- `tutorial1.py`
- `tutorial2.py`
- `tutorial3.py`
- `tutorial4.py`
- `tutorial5.py`

Run each script and observe:

- The difference between **serial execution**
- The difference between **parallel execution**
- Execution time comparisons
- How multiprocessing and process pools work

These tutorials demonstrate how Python can run tasks:
- sequentially (one after another)
- in parallel (multiple processes at the same time)

Understanding these examples will help you complete the exercises.

---

## Exercises

After reviewing `tutorial.md` and the tutorial scripts, complete the following exercises:

- `exercise1-2.md`
- `exercise2.md`
- `exercise3.md`

You should:
- Study the tutorial code carefully  
- Reuse ideas and patterns from the tutorials  
- Implement the required functions in the exercises  
- Test both serial and parallel versions  
- Measure execution time where required  

The exercises are designed to help you apply the concepts from the tutorials, including multiprocessing, process pools, and performance comparison.

---

## Expected workflow

1. Start with `tutorial.md`  
2. Read and understand the examples  
3. Run the tutorial scripts  
4. Observe the outputs and timings  
5. Modify the code if needed  
6. Work on the exercises  
7. Test your solutions  

Do **not** jump directly to the exercises without exploring `tutorial.md` and the tutorials first.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Standard libraries:
  - `time`
  - `multiprocessing`
  - `concurrent.futures`
  - `requests` (for Exercise 2)

---

## Goal

By completing these tutorials and exercises, you should be able to:

- Understand serial vs parallel execution  
- Use multiprocessing in Python  
- Use ProcessPoolExecutor  
- Measure performance  
- Apply parallel programming to real tasks
